echo Testing CompanyLock Enhanced Security Features
echo ======================================
echo.

echo [INFO] CompanyLock now includes enhanced security features to prevent lock screen bypass:
echo.
echo [SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED]
echo 1. Global Keyboard Hook - Low-level interception of dangerous key combinations
echo 2. Secure Window Management - Prevents task switching and window manipulation
echo 3. Alt+F4 Blocking - Cannot close lock screen with Alt+F4
echo 4. Alt+Tab Blocking - Cannot switch tasks with Alt+Tab
echo 5. Alt+Esc Blocking - Cannot use alternative task switcher
echo 6. Windows Key Blocking - Cannot open start menu or shortcuts
echo 7. Taskbar Hiding - Taskbar and start button hidden during lock
echo 8. Topmost Window - Lock screen stays on top of all windows
echo 9. System Menu Removal - No window controls (minimize, maximize, close)
echo 10. Fullscreen Enforcement - Window cannot be resized or moved
echo.

echo [WARNING] Some bypass methods CANNOT be blocked by user-mode applications:
echo - Ctrl+Alt+Del (Secure Attention Sequence) - System level, cannot be blocked
echo - Task Manager (if already running) - May require admin privileges to fully block
echo - Power button / forced shutdown - Physical security required
echo.

echo [TEST PROCEDURE]
echo We will test the following bypass attempts:
echo 1. Alt+F4 (should be blocked)
echo 2. Alt+Tab (should be blocked) 
echo 3. Alt+Esc (should be blocked)
echo 4. Windows key (should be blocked)
echo 5. Minimize/Close buttons (should be hidden)
echo 6. Window dragging/resizing (should be prevented)
echo 7. Taskbar access (should be hidden)
echo.

echo [STARTING LOCK SCREEN TEST]
echo Press any key to launch the lock screen with enhanced security...
pause

cd /d "%~dp0\src\CompanyLock.UI\bin\Release\net8.0-windows"
if exist CompanyLock.UI.exe (
    echo [INFO] Launching enhanced security lock screen...
    echo [INFO] Security features will be automatically enabled when window loads
    echo.
    
    echo ========================================
    echo SECURITY TEST INSTRUCTIONS
    echo ========================================
    echo.
    echo While the lock screen is active, try these bypass methods:
    echo.
    echo TEST 1: Press Alt+F4 
    echo   Expected: Should be BLOCKED, no effect
    echo   Status: Check console for "Blocked Alt+F4" message
    echo.
    echo TEST 2: Press Alt+Tab
    echo   Expected: Should be BLOCKED, task switcher should NOT appear
    echo   Status: Check console for "Blocked Alt+Tab" message
    echo.
    echo TEST 3: Press Alt+Esc
    echo   Expected: Should be BLOCKED, no task switching
    echo   Status: Check console for "Blocked Alt+Esc" message
    echo.
    echo TEST 4: Press Windows key
    echo   Expected: Should be BLOCKED, Start menu should NOT open
    echo   Status: Check console for "Blocked Windows key" message
    echo.
    echo TEST 5: Look for window controls
    echo   Expected: No minimize/maximize/close buttons visible
    echo   Status: Window should have no title bar or controls
    echo.
    echo TEST 6: Try to access taskbar
    echo   Expected: Taskbar should be HIDDEN
    echo   Status: Bottom of screen should show no taskbar
    echo.
    echo TEST 7: Try window manipulation
    echo   Expected: Cannot drag, resize, or move window
    echo   Status: Window should stay fullscreen and immobile
    echo.
    echo TEST 8: Check window layering
    echo   Expected: Lock screen stays on top of everything
    echo   Status: No other windows should be visible or accessible
    echo.
    echo ========================================
    echo NOTE: To close the lock screen for testing:
    echo - Use correct username/password to unlock, OR
    echo - If testing bypasses, use Ctrl+C in console to terminate
    echo ========================================
    echo.
    
    start CompanyLock.UI.exe
    echo [INFO] Lock screen launched with enhanced security!
    echo [INFO] Monitor the console window for security event logs
    echo [INFO] Try the bypass methods listed above to test security
    echo.
    
    echo [CONSOLE MONITORING]
    echo Watch this console for security messages like:
    echo - "Security enforcement enabled - keyboard shortcuts blocked"
    echo - "Blocked Alt+F4 attempt"
    echo - "Blocked Alt+Tab attempt" 
    echo - "Blocked Windows key attempt"
    echo - "Taskbar hidden for security"
    echo.
    
    timeout /t 5 /nobreak > nul
    echo [INFO] Security test in progress...
    echo [INFO] Press Ctrl+C here to terminate test if lock screen cannot be closed normally
    
) else (
    echo [ERROR] Lock screen executable not found!
    echo [INFO] Please build the solution first:
    echo        dotnet build CompanyLock.sln --configuration Release
    echo.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

echo.
echo [POST-TEST VERIFICATION]
echo After testing, verify the following:
echo.
echo âœ“ Alt+F4 was blocked (check console logs)
echo âœ“ Alt+Tab was blocked (no task switcher appeared)
echo âœ“ Alt+Esc was blocked (no task switching)
echo âœ“ Windows key was blocked (no Start menu)
echo âœ“ Taskbar was hidden during lock
echo âœ“ Window stayed fullscreen and topmost
echo âœ“ No window controls were visible
echo âœ“ Window could not be moved or resized
echo.
echo [SECURITY ASSESSMENT]
echo Rate the effectiveness of each security measure:
echo - Keyboard blocking: Test each shortcut
echo - Window security: Try to manipulate window
echo - UI hiding: Check if taskbar/controls are hidden
echo - Topmost enforcement: Try to bring other windows to front
echo.

echo ======================================
echo Enhanced Security Testing Complete
echo ======================================
echo.
echo [IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY]
echo âœ“ SecurityEnforcementService - Low-level keyboard hooks
echo âœ“ SecureWindowService - Window manipulation prevention  
echo âœ“ LockScreen integration - Multi-layer security
echo âœ“ Real-time logging - Security event monitoring
echo âœ“ UX considerations - Graceful security enforcement
echo.
